The media industry has never had a shortage of big-name personalities. Swashbucklers, if you will, are always ready to spend big money on a potential hot film or a prized acquisition. One of the media industry’s legends is Liberty Media's John Malone. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Malone built up cable TV outfit TCI through key deals and aggressive expansion. He sold it to AT&amp;T (T) for over $50 billion in 1999. Malone has gone on to be known as the man behind Liberty Media (LLYVA, FWONA), a media conglomerate whose crown jewel is Formula One. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Liberty Media chair John Malone. Malone is out with a new book, Born to be Wired.
